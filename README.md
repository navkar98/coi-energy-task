# COI Energy BACKEND TASK

  

Welcome! 🎉


This is a Node.js/Express.js app that will serve a REST API.

## Data Models

> **All models are defined in src/model.js**

### Profile
A profile can be either a `client` or a `contractor`. 
clients create contracts with contractors. contractor does jobs for clients and get paid.
Each profile has a balance property.

### Contract
A contract between and client and a contractor.
Contracts have 3 statuses, `new`, `in_progress`, `terminated`. contracts are considered active only when in status `in_progress`
Contracts group jobs within them.

### Job
contractor get paid for jobs by clients under a certain contract.

## Getting Set Up

  
It requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. LTS version is recommended.

  

1. Start by cloning this repository.

  

1. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

  

1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

  

1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.

  

  
  

## Technical Notes

  

- The server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which will automatically restart for you when you modify and save a file.

- The database provider is SQLite, which will store data in a file local to your repository called `database.sqlite3`. The ORM [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is on top of it.

- To authenticate users use the `getProfile` middleware that is located under src/middleware/getProfile.js. users are authenticated by passing `profile_id` in the request header. after a user is authenticated his profile will be available under `req.profile`. make sure only users that are on the contract can access their contracts.
- The server is running on port 3001.

  

## APIs Implemented

  

Below is a list of the API's implemented for the application.

  


1. ***GET*** `/contracts/:id` - This API is now fixed! It returns the contract only if it belongs to the profile calling.

1. ***GET*** `/contracts` - Returns a list of contracts belonging to a user (client or contractor), the list should only contain non terminated contracts.

1. ***GET*** `/jobs/unpaid` -  Get all unpaid jobs for a user (***either*** a client or contractor), for ***active contracts only***.

1. ***POST*** `/jobs/:job_id/pay` - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance. ***Added: A payment can only be authorized by the client for that particular job***

1. ***POST*** `/balances/deposit/:userId` - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-profession?start=<date>&end=<date>` - Returns the profession that earned the most money (sum of jobs paid) for any contactor that worked in the query time range.

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-clients?start=<date>&end=<date>&limit=<integer>` - returns the clients the paid the most for jobs in the query time period. limit query parameter should be applied, default limit is 2.

        "id": 1,
        "fullName": "Reece Moyer",
        "paid" : 100.3
    },
    {
        "id": 200,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 99
    },
    {
        "id": 22,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 21
    }
]
```

  

## Unit Test

There is a file named as ```test-cases.postman_collection``` where you can find postman api collection which unit tests the above api's. Please import them in postman to check if api's are working properly.
